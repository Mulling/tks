The Tuned Kernel Service (TKS) is a community-driven tool designed to manage kernel configurations and patches for specific machines. It allows you to build, benchmark, and fine-tune the kernel to your liking. Users can also share their configurations, making them available for others to use.

Currently under development:
```bash
tks new "ultra fast kernel"

tks patch *.patch

tks build

tks install

tks kexec
```
